   Yoni               classmate      Discussed how to get the number from the file (generate waltz)

   Prabin                TA          Discussed the appoach you should take in solving the problem (play waltz)

4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz)
      Approach: In this problem first I need to create two 2d arrays to match the numbers in the file by using
      create2d and store zeros in it as placeholders. Then I looped through the 2d array and replaced each 0 in
      the 2d array to a numbers in the file. After that I looped through the columns of the array of numbers and
      randomly rolled dice to chose two rows from the array of numbers and add them together. Lastly I stored
      the exact value of the row and column into a variable and displayed it onto the terminal.

      Issues and resolution: I had difficulty with trying to figure out how to be able to replace the numbers
      in the 2d array to the numbers in the file. It was causing me to try to loop through the rows and columns
      of the array separately for each them. Doing that caused me to have trouble replacing the zeros in the array at
      the same time. But found out that I should have used a nested for loop on the 2d arrays to replace he numbers.
      for i in range(11): and  for j in range(16) inside. After fixing it, I was able to add the numbers into
      the nested loop.

   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz)
      Approach: First I stored the numbers that are in the file mozart into a variable. Then I made sure that
      the measure was not 32 using an if and an exit statement. len(waltz) != 32: sys.exit. After that I
      looped through the first 16 minutes and exited if the number was greater 176 and less than 1. Also
      looped through the last 16 minutes and exited if the number was greater 96 and less than 1. Lastly I
      looped through each minute and played the sound using from the file name and the number.

      Issues and resolution: This problem did not have too many issues I had to face. The most difficult
      part of this problem was trying to understand figure out what the problem asking me to do. The code was
      not especially complicated but figuring out the problem was. It was causing me to use the if statements
      and for loops for from 0-32. This caused the program not play because some numbers that did not
      match the sound. But I found that doing 1-16 and 16-32 loops and if statements separately. After
      fixing it, my code was clearner, and I was able to fix my errors better.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was difficult, but I learned alot through it. It allowed me to put the skills that I learned
   in class to practice. It did not take as long as I expect because of the less amount of problems. Also,
   some exercises were more time-consuming and difficult than problem 2. The programming I have been learning
   in class made it easier to understand and figure out. Also, my problem-solving skills has gotten alot better
   since the first project we did.
